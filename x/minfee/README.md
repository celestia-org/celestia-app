# `x/minfee`

## Abstract

The `x/minfee` module is responsible for managing the gov-modifiable parameter `GlobalMinGasPrice` introduced in app version 2. `GlobalMinGasPrice` ensures that all transactions adhere to this global minimum threshold, which is set in the genesis file and can be updated via governance proposals.
